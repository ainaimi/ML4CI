    This course is an elective for Masters and PhD students at 
    <a href='https://www.sph.emory.edu/'>Emory University Rollins School of Public Health</a>. 
    The course covers some fundamental tools used in modern (reproducible) data science. 
    Together, these tools 
    provide the ability to develop fully reproducible pipelines for data 
    analysis. By the end of the course students will have learned the tools necessary to: 
    develop reproducible workflows collaboratively using version control based on 
    <a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a> and <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a>, 
    execute these workflows on a local computer using command line operations, 
    <a href='https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/'>R Markdown</a>, 
    and <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/make/'>GNU Make</a>, 
    execute the workflows in a containerized environment using 
    <a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a>, and execute the workflow in a cloud 
    environment using <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/'>Amazon Web Services</a> 
    <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>EC2</a> and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a> services. 
    Along the way, we will 
    cover a few other tools for data science including best coding practices, basic 
    <a href='https://www.python.org/'>python</a>, 
    software unit testing, and <a href='https://travis-ci.com/'>continuous integration services</a>.
